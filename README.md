The Exercises Solved in JS File :<br/>
// The exe. are commented too in the JS file

1 -  Assignment One => 
 - You have the following Constructor Function to convert to Class Syntax
 - Do not rely on the program and do it yourself to make sure that you know the Syntax
 - Add two Methods, one named run and one named stop
 Each of them contains a message
 - The first is Car Is Running Now and the second is Car Is Stopped
 - Create 3 cars with this class with any data you choose
 - Print the data of the first car of them in the console, as shown below
 - In the next line, type the method called run .

2 - Assignment Two => 
  - We have the next class called Phone
  - We need to make another class in the name of Tablet that inherits the properties of the Phone Class
  - The Tablet Class contains an additional Property, which is the size
  - It also contains a Method named fullDetails
  - We used the class called Tablet to create more than one Tablet
  - Then we used the method called fullDetails, which prints data on the tablet
  - Now all you have to do is create the Tablet Class to show the data as it is below
  - If the person does not type the size, the word “Unknown” should appear
  
3 - Assignment Three =>
  - We need to modify it as you want to implement the requirements below
  - First, prevent access to Card Property directly
  - When creating users, you notice that each person wrote the Card Number in a different way
  - We need all the numbers to be a String and after every 4 digits a sign - as in the Output
  - Do not modify the user creation lines nor the console lines

// TIP => You can search for Getters to get the method value as Property<br/>
// You can use RegExp to convert the number to Credit Card format

4 - Assignment Four =>
  - You have the next String
  - Then we used a method called addLove
  - The result appeared as in the Output below
  - What do you need to write to run this method and show the desired result?
 
5 - Assignment Five =>
  - We have the next Object
  - Next, there is a line that changes the Score . value
  - Next, there is a Loop. It prints the entire content of the object, the name of the property, and the value next to it
  - After that, the content of the object is printed in the console
  - It is forbidden to modify the content of the Object, the Loop, or the Print line in the Console
  - In the space provided, you must write the code to do the required
  - Required not to allow change of score value
  - It is required not to show the id inside the loop, but it appears without any problem in the content of the object in the console
  - It is required that the country not appear in the Loop, nor in the content of the Object in the Console
